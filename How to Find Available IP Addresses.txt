1. Press the “Windows-R” key combination to open the “Run” window.

2. Type “cmd” (without the quotes) in the Open text entry box and click the “OK” button.

3. Enter the command: “FOR /L %i IN (1, 1, 254) DO ping -a -n 1 192.168.1.%i | FIND /i “Reply”>> c:\ipaddresses.txt”.

4. Press “Enter.” This command takes several minutes to process and writes the results to a file named “ipaddresses.txt” 
in the the root directory of the “C:” drive. You can view this file with Notepad. 
All assigned addresses have the notation “bytes=32 time=xx TTL=128” and addresses without this message are available.

Tip
Substitute “192.168.1.” in the command string with your local network ID. 
The numbers in parentheses, in order, indicate the starting segment address, the increment value and the ending address segment.

Warning
Access to the root of the “C:\” drive is restricted by default with versions of Windows newer than Windows XP. 
If you are using Windows Vista or Windows7, create a new directory before running this command and change the destination to 
“c:\mydirectory\ipaddresses.txt.”
